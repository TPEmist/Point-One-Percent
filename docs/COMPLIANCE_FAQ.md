# Enterprise Compliance FAQ: pop-pay

This document provides a detailed overview of the compliance, security, and data privacy architecture for pop-pay, the open-source AI agent commerce runtime security layer.

## 1. PCI DSS Scope

**Is pop-pay in scope for PCI DSS?**

No. pop-pay is a local developer tool and runtime security layer, not a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) or payment processor. By architecture, pop-pay ensures that sensitive cardholder data (CHD) never enters pop-pay infrastructure or any external API.

**Data Flow Architecture:**
Card data flows from a local encrypted vault → Policy Enforcement Point (PEP) RAM (ephemeral) → Context Isolation Layer injection into the browser DOM → Payment Processor.

Because the data is handled entirely within the user's local environment or the specific merchant's payment iframe via the Context Isolation Layer, pop-pay does not store, process, or transmit cardholder data on its own servers. Using pop-pay helps organizations maintain a smaller PCI DSS footprint by keeping agentic commerce operations localized and isolated.

## 3. Credential Isolation Model

pop-pay employs a multi-layered isolation strategy to protect sensitive financial credentials during agentic workflows.

### Layer 1: Storage Isolation
*   **Mechanism:** AES-256-GCM encrypted vault.
*   **Key Derivation:** scrypt KDF with system-level salts.
*   **Integration:** Integration with the OS system keychain ensures that the master encryption key is never stored in plaintext on disk.

### Layer 2: Runtime Isolation
*   **Mechanism:** Policy Enforcement Point (PEP).
*   **Boundary:** The PEP operates as a separate process via the MCP JSON-RPC protocol. Card data resides in this process's ephemeral memory only for the duration of an **Ephemeral Authorization Scope**.
*   **Protection:** Even if the primary AI agent process is compromised, it does not have direct memory access to the PEP’s raw credential store.

### Layer 3: Transport Isolation
*   **Mechanism:** Context Isolation Layer.
*   **Injection:** Credentials are injected directly into cross-origin iframes using the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
*   **Zero-Knowledge Card Surface:** This ensures that the parent page (which might be controlled by an untrusted agent or script) cannot programmatically scrape the card details, as they are isolated by the browser's Same-Origin Policy (SOP).

## 4. SOC 2 Roadmap

pop-pay is currently an open-source project. While we do not currently hold a SOC 2 attestation, we are committed to a phased compliance roadmap.

*   **Phase 0 (Current):** Open-source codebase available for independent audit. Security penetration testing results available to enterprise partners upon request.
*   **Phase 1 (Post-Funding/Scale):** Formal SOC 2 Gap Assessment and implementation of formal internal controls.
*   **Phase 2 (6-9 Months):** Achievement of SOC 2 Type I Attestation (Design of Controls).
*   **Phase 3 (12-18 Months):** Achievement of SOC 2 Type II Attestation (Operating Effectiveness).

## 5. GDPR & CCPA Note

**Privacy by Design:**
pop-pay is built on a "local-first" philosophy.
*   **Local Processing:** All data processing occurs on the user's machine.
*   **Zero Telemetry:** No usage data, card information, or PII is sent to pop-pay servers or third-party analytics.
*   **Data Control:** The user is the sole Data Controller.
*   **Right to Erasure:** Users can exercise their "right to be forgotten" instantly by deleting their local vault file and keychain entries.

| Framework | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PCI DSS** | N/A | CHD never enters pop-pay infrastructure. |
| **SOC 2 Type I** | Planned | Phase 2 of compliance roadmap. |

| **GDPR/CCPA** | Compliant | Compliant by architecture (Local-only, no telemetry). |
| **OSS Audit** | Available | MIT licensed codebase available for public inspection. |
| **Penetration Test** | On Request | Available for enterprise evaluation. |

## 7. Known Limitations

While pop-pay provides robust security, users should be aware of the following architectural trade-offs:

*   **Host Security:** A compromised host (same-user shell) could potentially access the vault file. This is mitigated but not eliminated by OS keychain integration.
*   **Post-Injection DOM Access:** Once credentials are injected into a DOM element, JavaScript running within *that specific iframe* can technically read the values. We rely on the **Intent Verification Engine** to ensure the target site is a trusted processor.
*   **OSS Transparency:** As an open-source project, vault encryption logic and salts (if applicable) are visible in the source code. Security relies on the strength of the user's passphrase and the scrypt KDF.
*   **Hardware Security:** pop-pay currently lacks native Hardware Security Module (HSM) or Secure Enclave integration for the primary vault (planned for future releases).
